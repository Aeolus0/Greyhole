#### Landing Zone ####
# The landing zone is the directory that contains all your shares.
# All the shares defined in your smb.conf should be sub-directories of this 
# directory.
# You should use your biggest partition as the landing zone, as this is what 
# will be used to store the incoming files until Greyhole move them somewhere 
# else.

	landing_zone = /mnt/hdd0/shares

#### Graveyard ####
# The graveyard is where 'tombstones' are saved. Tombstones are small text 
# files that contain metadata about your files.
# For example, it contains the paths to all copies of a file, and flags to 
# indicate if the copy is currently available or not.
# The number of file copies you'll have will define how much space the 
# graveyard will take.
# 100,000 file copies should take approximately 400 MB of graveyard space.

	graveyard = /mnt/hdd1/graveyard

# Make sure you put your landing zone and graveyard on two distinct hard 
# drive; fsck will use one to re-construct the other, if one of the drive 
# fails.
# You don't want to loose both directories if a single drive fails! While it 
# would still be technically feasible to reconstruct both by walking all 
# storage pool directories, fsck doesn't do that at this time.

#### Shares Settings ####
# Number of copies of each file you want Greyhole to keep, per Share.
# This is not the number of duplicates! 2 copies = 1 duplicate
# If you change one of those, you should run fsck manually, or wait for the 
# daily fsck (you created that cron, right?), to have the additional copies 
# created, or extra copies deleted.

	num_copies[Backups] = 2
	num_copies[CrashPlan] = 1
	num_copies[Games] = 2
	num_copies[Music] = 2

#### Storage Pool ####
# Where should the file copies be kept?
# You probably want to list all your physical hard drives here.
# Also specify how much free space you want to reserve on each drive. This is 
# a soft limit that will be ignored if the necessary hard drives are below 
# their minimum.
# For example, if you specify a 100 GB limit on all drives, and only one still 
# have more than 100 GB of free space, and you save a new file on a share for 
# which you specified you want multiple copies, this drive will be used first, 
# but the other drives that have less free space will be used to store the 
# additional copies.

#### Storage Selection Algorithm ####
# available algorithms: random, most_available_space
#   most_available_space: use the directories with the most available space 
#     first, so that available space on all drives should become and stay 
#     balanced.
#   random: use a random directory with available space

	dir_selection_algorithm = most_available_space

# When selecting drives using their available / free space, the last cached value will be used.
# Use 0 to disable caching.
