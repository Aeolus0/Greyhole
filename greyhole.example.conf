#### Landing Zone ####
# The landing zone is now deprecated. If you still have this setting in your

#### Graveyard ####
# The centralized graveyard is now deprecated. Do not define a graveyard below

#### Shares Settings ####
# Number of copies of each file you want Greyhole to keep, per Share.
# This is not the number of duplicates! 2 copies = 1 duplicate
# If you change one of those, you should run fsck manually, or wait for the 
# daily fsck (you created that cron, right?), to have the additional copies 
# created, or extra copies deleted.

	num_copies[Backups] = 2
	num_copies[CrashPlan] = 2
	num_copies[Games] = 2

	num_copies[Videos] = 2

#### Storage Pool ####
# Where should the file copies be kept?
# You probably want to list all your physical hard drives here.
# Also specify how much free space you want to reserve on each drive. This is 
# a soft limit that will be ignored if the necessary hard drives are below 
# their minimum.
# For example, if you specify a 100 GB limit on all drives, and only one still 
# have more than 100 GB of free space, and you save a new file on a share for 
# which you specified you want multiple copies, this drive will be used first, 
# but the other drives that have less free space will be used to store the 
# additional copies.

	storage_pool_directory = /mnt/hdd6/gh, min_free: 10gb

#### Storage Selection Algorithm ####
# available algorithms: random, most_available_space
#   most_available_space: use the directories with the most available space 
#     first, so that available space on all drives should become and stay 
#     balanced.
#   random: use a random directory with available space

	dir_selection_algorithm = most_available_space

#### Sticky Files ####
# Sticky files are files that will always 'live' together, in the storage pool.
#
# This will allow you to read (and read-only!) those files by using the 
# storage pool directories themselves, instead of using the mounted shares.
# To see when that might be useful, read Issue #3 at the URL below.
# [http://code.google.com/p/greyhole/issues/detail?id=3]
#
# Each sticky_files line should start with the name of a share, followed by a 
# directory inside that share.
# One or more stick_into lines should follow each sticky_files line, if you 
# want the files to go on specific hard drive(s).
# If you don't specify any stick_into, the drive with the most free space will 
# be use to hold your files together.

	sticky_files = Music/

#	sticky_files = Videos/Movies/
#		stick_into = /mnt/hdd1/gh
#		stick_into = /mnt/hdd5/gh

# How long should free space calculations be cached (in seconds).
# When selecting drives using their available / free space, the last cached 
# value will be used.
# Use 0 to disable caching.

	df_cache_time = 15

#### Attic ####
# Move deleted files to attic, instead of deleting them?
# (Yes, attic is just another name for a 'Recycle Bin'...)
# You can specify per-share preferences that will override the global 
# preference.

	delete_moves_to_attic = yes
	delete_moves_to_attic[CrashPlan] = no
	delete_moves_to_attic[TimeMachine] = no
